How to run...
    1. Open in integrated Terminal.
    2. In the terminal window. Enter "mingw32-make". (in this case I use g++ compiler)
    (After the program has finished compiling. The compiler will generate a main.exe file.)
    3. Then in the terminal window enter ".\'main.exe'" to run the program.
